# BouncingBall Game using QML and C++
- The code defines a game in which a ball bounces around the screen and can be controlled by a user-draggable paddle at the bottom of the screen. When the ball hits the paddle, the ball bounces back up and the player scores a hit. If the ball falls off the bottom of the screen, the player scores a miss. 
- The player's score (number of hits minus number of misses) is displayed on the screen.
- The game is implemented using the QtQuick framework, which provides a set of QML (Qt Modeling Language) elements for creating user interfaces. The code is made up of several elements, including Window, Timer, Rectangle, and Text.
- The Window element defines the overall game window, including its size and title. 
- The Timer element is used to update the game state and redraw the screen at a regular interval. 
- The Rectangle elements are used to define the ball, the paddle, and the container for the game elements. 
- The Text element is used to display the player's score.
- The game's logic is implemented in the onTriggered event handler of the Timer element. 
- This event handler is called every time the timer fires, which occurs at a regular interval specified by the interval property of the timer. 
- The event handler contains several if statements that check the position of the ball and the paddle, and update their positions and the player's score accordingly.
- The paddle can be moved left and right by the player using the left and right arrow keys. 
- The movement of the paddle is animated using a Behavior element and a `Number
